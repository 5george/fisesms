## Overview

FISE is a social inclusion policy mechanism of the Republic of Peru, aimed at expanding the energy frontier in vulnerable segments of the population, through:

The massification of the use of natural gas (residential and vehicular) in vulnerable sectors.
The development of new supplies in the energy frontier focused on the most vulnerable populations.
Promoting access to LPG for vulnerable urban and rural sectors.
The compensation mechanism for the residential electricity tariff.

#### How does it work?

Text messages (SMS) are sent to the number `+55555` with the discount code (`VALE`) and the `DNI` number of the beneficiary.

```html
fise ah01 <DNI> <VALE>
```

To check the balance, proceed as follows:

```
saldo ah01
```

The system processes the message and returns a text message with the result of the operation.
